INTRO:
I LIKE TO BE AN EDUCATIONAL SPECIALIST WHO WOULD CHANGE THE NATURE OF EDUCATION SYSTEM IN INDIA.

PROBLEM:
FROM KINDERGARTEN THE STUDENTS CARRY BAG TO SCHOOL . NO MATTER THEY PROGRESS OR NOT, THE BAG GETS HEAVIER EACH YEAR. 
wE ARE FOLLOWING A SYSTEM WHERE WE BELEIVE GRADES DECIDE OUR FUTURE, AS IT TURNS OUT, ITS NOT.


WHY  THIS IS A PROBLEM?
WE HUMANS IMPROVED A LOT IN THE LAST 2 DECADES BUT WHY NOT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM ?.  

SOLUTION:
I WOULD IMPLEMENT A GAME ORIENTED AND FUN WAY OF LEARNING RIGHT FROM THE KINDERGAREN.

HOW IT IS IMPLEMENTED:
MORAL VALUES ARE MADE A PART OF EDUCATION.
THE STUDENTS MUST BE GIVEN PRIVILEGE TO CHOSE EACH AND EVERY SUBJECT THEY LEARN AND NOT JUST THE CURRICULUM.


WE INDIANS MAY NOT BE IN A DEVELOPED COUNTRY, NOW. BUT ORGANISING THE EDUCATION SYSTEM WE WLL SEE THEM ACHIEVE THIS FEAT.
